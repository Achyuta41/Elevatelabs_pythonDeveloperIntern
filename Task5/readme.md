# ðŸ§© Education Data Analysis using Python and Pandas

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project performs **data analysis on educational institution data** using **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn**.  
The dataset contains details of schools, their types, and student enrollments (male, female, and total) across different grades.  

The main goal is to **analyze enrollment patterns** across **school types**, **education sectors**, and **gender**, and to visualize the findings.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze and visualize education data stored in a CSV file to derive insights such as:
- Which **education sector** (e.g., Catholic, Government, etc.) has the most students.
- Which **school type** (Primary, Secondary, etc.) dominates in student enrollment.
- What the **gender distribution** among students looks like.
- How enrollment varies across **school numbers**.
